Worksheet #3: Knowledge Base Queries & Linked Open Data

Task 1. How is Concordia University in the DBpedia knowledge graph linked to Wikidata? Find theÏ
property and object for:
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Concordia University>

Task 2. Your first SPARQL query: What can you find in DBpedia withÏ
SELECT ?o

WHERE {

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Concordia_University> dbp:location ?o

}

You can run this query using DBpedia’s public SPARQL endpoint at https://dbpedia.org/sparql/.

Task 3. Let’s try out DESCRIBE: Can you explain the result fromÏ
DESCRIBE ?s

WHERE { ?s geo:lat "45.496944"^^xsd:float .

?s geo:long "-73.578056"^^xsd:float . }

Note that the prefix abbreviations geo and xsd are pre-defined in the query interface.1

Task 4. Now find all predicates and objects that have dbr:Concordia University as the subject :Ï
SELECT . . .

WHERE {

. . .

}

Hint: the subject URI is given and you need variables for the predicate and the object. Note that you
can use the pre-defined prefix dbr (for http://dbpedia.org/resource/) in your query.

Task 5. Create a query that prints out the URI and optionally the foaf:homepage of all universitiesÏ
and colleges located in Montreal:

PREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>

SELECT ?uname ?uhomepage

WHERE {

. . .

}

Hint: Look for a property that gives you “all colleges and universities in Montreal.” Note that Concordia
doesn’t have a foaf:homepage listed in DBpedia, but Dawson College has one.

Task 6. Using a FILTER, find all universities and colleges in Montreal that have more than 10000 studentsÏ
(dbo:numberOfStudents):

PREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>

PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>

SELECT ?uni ?num

WHERE {

. . .

FILTER

}

Bonus task: sort the output by the number of students (you’ll need an ORDER BY clause).

Task 7. If you ask Eliza, “Is the Yangtze river longer than the Nile River?”, you’ll get a passive-aggressiveÏ
answer like “I’ll ask the questions, if you don’t mind!”. Can you do better by writing a SPARQL ASK query
for the DBpedia knowledge graph?

PREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>

PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>

ASK

{

. . .

}

Hint: the URIs for the two rivers are dbr:Yangtze and dbr:Nile. Find the property for the length, bind
each value to a variable and add a FILTER to check if one is bigger than the other.
