Summary I

“Data is the new oil”

Organizations have invaluable knowledge “hidden” in documents:
• Products, inventions, solutions, techniques, experiences, insights, . . .

NLP/Text Mining can unlock this knowledge

What do you need?

• Need business vision to drive adoption
• Technology is mature and foundations are open source

E.g., IBM’s UIMA or University of Sheffield’s GATE

Risks

• Increasing legal and ethical concerns
E.g., Ethical AI, Responsible AI, Explainable AI

• Enriching content with machine-readable metadata
• Resource Description Framework (RDF) as a formal language
• Every statement is a triple: <subject, predicate, object>
• Offers SPARQL query language

Summary II

Overcoming Information Silos

• Knowledge Graphs can integrate different sources within an organization
(full text, databases, spreadsheets, etc.)

• Automatically manage an organization’s knowledge;
discover novel insights by combining multiple sources

• External Knowledge Bases to further enrich the data

What do you need?

• State-of-the-art technology: graph databases, triple stores, reasoning engines,
etc.

• Reasonably mature technology (open source & commercial), many SAAS
vendors

Brief History of Chatbots

Turing Test: “A truly intelligent machine would be
indistinguishable from a human” (A. Turing, 1950)

Early chatbots were developed by scientists:

• MIT Eliza (1966), the psychotherapist bot

• Stanford Parry (1972), the schizophrenic patient

• A.L.I.C.E (1995), the companion AI

Eliza (1966)

How does Eliza work?

See Weizenbaum’s paper at:
http://www.universelle-automation.de/1966_Boston.pdf

“Input sentences are analyzed on the basis of decomposition rules which
are triggered by key words appearing in the input text. Responses are gen-
erated by reassembly rules associated with selected decomposition rules.”

Eliza Example

Eliza + DOCTOR script

If the input sentence is:
I am very unhappy these days.

Eliza’s response will be:
How long have you been very unhappy these days?

Processing

Keyword:
I am

Decomposition pattern:
I am <whatever>

Reassembly Pattern:
How long have you been <whatever>?

GPT-2: The “unicorn” example

Human Input

“In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote,
previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the
researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.”

GPT-2 Generated Output

“The scientist named the population, after their distinctive horn, Ovid’s Unicorn.
These four-horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science.

Now, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon
is finally solved.

Dr. Jorge Pérez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and several
companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley,
with no other animals or humans. Pérez noticed that the valley had what appeared
to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow.

Pérez and the others then ventured further into the valley. “By the time we reached
the top of one peak, the water looked blue, with some crystals on top,” said Pérez.”

Human Input

“For today’s homework assignment, please describe the reasons for the US Civil
War.”

GPT-2 Generated Output

“It is easy to identify why the Civil War happened, because so many people and so
many books and so much television and films tell us that it was the cause, that it
has something to do with race or economics or religion. There is much agreement
that it was essentially a war of slavery on behalf of capitalism, about a century of
slavery. But that’s not what most people think of when they think of the Civil War.
Many people think of the war as about states rights. You’re not wrong about that,
but it’s kind of misleading to say that the Civil War was a conflict between states’
rights and federalism. So let’s try again. What’s the idea that has inspired so many
people to go onto the battlefields of Gettysburg and Antietam and Gettysberg and
Petersburg and Fredericksburg? The American idea of the republic–a notion of
limited government–is a great part of the history....”

Chatbots: The Business Case

What do you need?

• Specify the business case
• Define concrete use cases
• Determine KPIs and evaluate
• Re-envision Risk Management

• Select a vendor or develop in-house
• Be aware of the bot lifecycle

Summary

• “Hot” business topic, emerging after decades of research
• Huge difference in scope (simple rules vs. sophisticated reasoning)
• Again, new legal and ethical issues

E.g., bots pretending to be human, political campaigning, medical advice
